# BetterYTSubBox

BetterYTSubBox is a project that has a simple goal of providing people with a way to use YouTube and get the latest videos from their favorite content creators without having the YouTube Sub box deciding what to show you.

A little background is that I have almost near 400 subscriptions to channels and I have to keep visiting many of them to ever see any of their videos and it has gotten to the point where it is just straight up annoying having to do that each and every time I want to see a video. I would jump onto YouTube and the only videos I would see are from what the algorithm deemed I should see.
